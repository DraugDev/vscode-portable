# vscode-portable
Just a small wrapper to make VSCode run from any USB-Stick, so that all data will be stored within its folder.

# Structure
This project should have following structure in order to run properly.
```
VSCode.exe
app  -- folder with app files (you can update vscode version at any time just by copying it here)
data  -- will be created with user data and settings files
ext  -- extensions you have downloaded will be stored here
```

Alternatively, just download release files.
